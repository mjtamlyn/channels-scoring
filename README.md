# Scoring proof of concept using channels

This is a proof of concept application using
[django-channels](https://channels.readthedocs.io/) to implement live updating
leaderboards and data input for a scoring app similar to
[TamlynScore](https://github.com/mjtamlyn/archery-scoring).

## Setup

```
createdb channels_scoring
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py runserver
```
